# Sales-Visualization
The business objective of the Visualization of Sample Store Data Set project is to gain valuable insights into the store's performance and customer behavior through visualizations and data analysis.
By exploring key metrics such as sales, customer demographics, product performance, and trends, the project aims to help store managers and decision-makers make data-driven decisions to optimize operations, improve sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.
